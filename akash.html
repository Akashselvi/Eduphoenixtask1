    Marketing refers to all activities a company does     
    <b class="para">to promote and sell products or services to consumers.
</b><br>
    
    
    <br>
   Marketing makes use of the <b>"marketing mix,"</b> also known as the four Psâ€”product, price, place, and promotion.
<br>

Marketing used to be centered around traditional marketing techniques including television, radio, mail, and word-of-mouth strategies.
<br>

Though traditional marketing is still prevalent, digital marketing now allows companies to engage in newsletter, social media, affiliate, and content marketing strategies.<br>
